# Daily Learning Log

## 📅 22 Dec 2025

### Topics Covered
- Arrays
- Two-Pointer Technique

### Problems Solved
- Kth Largest Element in an Array (LeetCode)
- Move Zeros to End (LeetCode)

### Key Learnings
- Sorting-based solutions result in **O(n log n)** time complexity
- Two-pointer technique using a **traversal pointer** and a **placement pointer**
- In-place swapping using **constant extra space**
- Writing clean, readable comments improves code clarity and understanding
- Properly documenting solutions for GitHub repositories

### GitHub Progress
- Added array solutions inside the `Arrays` folder
- Updated `Arrays/README.md` with problem listings
- Added comments explaining the approach and time/space complexity

### Notes
- Two-pointer approach preserves the relative order of non-zero elements
- Consistent documentation strengthens problem-solving confidence
