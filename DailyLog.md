# Daily Learning Log

## 📅 22 Dec 2025

### Topics Covered
- Arrays
- Two-Pointer Technique

---

### Problems Solved
- Kth Largest Element in an Array (LeetCode)
- Move Zeros to End (LeetCode)

---

### Key Learnings
- Sorting-based solutions result in **O(n log n)** time complexity
- Two-pointer technique using a **traversal pointer** and a **placement pointer**
- In-place swapping using **constant extra space**
- Writing clean, readable comments improves code clarity and understanding
- Properly documenting solutions for GitHub repositories

---

### GitHub Progress
- Added array solutions inside the `Arrays` folder
- Updated `Arrays/README.md` with problem listings
- Added comments explaining the approach and time/space complexity

---

### Notes
- Two-pointer approach preserves the relative order of non-zero elements
- Consistent documentation strengthens problem-solving confidence

## 📅 23 Dec 2025

### Topics Covered
- Arrays  
- Stack  

---

### Problems Solved
- Reverse String (Arrays – LeetCode)  
- Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation (Stack – LeetCode)  
- Baseball Game (Stack – LeetCode)  

---

### Key Learnings
- Reverse String:
  - Can be solved using *two-pointer technique*
  - In-place swapping gives *O(1)* extra space  
- Reverse Polish Notation (RPN):
  - Evaluated using a *stack*
  - Operands are pushed to stack
  - Operators pop two elements, apply operation, and push result  
  - Operand order matters (b - a, b / a)  
- Baseball Game:
  - Stack helps track previous valid scores
  - Supports undo (C), double (D), and sum (+) operations  
- Stack-based problems strengthen understanding of:
  - Expression evaluation
  - State tracking  

---

### Notes
- Two-pointer technique is efficient for array manipulation problems  
- Stack is highly effective for problems involving previous state or history  
- These problems are commonly asked in *coding rounds*
